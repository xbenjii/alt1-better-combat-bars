- **Transparency**: Adjust overall overlay opacity (0-100%)
- **Themes**: Choose from predefined color themes or create your own

## Troubleshooting

### Overlay Not Detecting Stats
1. **Check Game Interface**: Ensure your combat stats are visible on screen
2. **Interface Scale**: Make sure RuneScape's interface scaling is supported
3. **Overlay Position**: The overlay needs to be able to "see" your stats bars
4. **Alt1 Permissions**: Verify Alt1 has screen capture permissions

### Performance Issues
1. **Update Frequency**: Reduce the update frequency in settings
2. **Hide Unused Bars**: Disable bars you don't need
3. **Lower Transparency**: Reduce overlay complexity by using solid colors

### Settings Not Saving
1. **Browser Permissions**: Ensure local storage is enabled
2. **Alt1 Version**: Update to the latest Alt1 Toolkit version
3. **Clear Cache**: Try clearing the app's cache and reconfiguring

### Common Solutions
- **Restart Alt1**: Close and reopen Alt1 Toolkit
- **Reload App**: Right-click the app and select "Reload"
- **Reset Settings**: Use the "Reset to Defaults" button in settings
